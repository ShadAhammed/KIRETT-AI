## KIRETT Machine Learning Model to detect rescue situation
==============================
This software is created to develop ML-based predictive models to check if certain complications 
persist for a rescue patient.

## Description
In KIRETT Project total 6 health complications were considered as below:
1. Cardiovascular Complication
2. Respiratory and Cardio Complication
3. Neurology Complication
4. Metabollic Complication
5. Psychiatric Complication
6. Abdominal Complication

Machine learning models developed are:
1. Artificial Neural Network
2. K-nearest Neighbout
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Logistic Regression
5. Xtreme Gradient Boosting
6. Random Forest
7. Naive Bayes

But the model will work for any given data and provide a classification and performance report indicating the best model
for a given training data.

### Dependencies

* Check requirements.txt for the required library
* Windows/Linux

### How to use

Clone the repository to your local computer using git clone <remote>.
Afterward, just run the software and select the training data file to get the ML model's performance overview.
